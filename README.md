# CDH-Subsystem_Common
This repository is to be used for the common software to be implemented on subsystem microcontrollers (ATMEGA32M1).

This code is take from an example written by employees at Digikey, I 
am using it as a starting point for the subsytem code we will be using 
for our subsystem microcontrollers on the satellite. This software is 
designed to run on an STK600 development board with an ATSTK600-SC10 
socket card, and ATSTK600-RC22 Routing card. A link to the example project is here:

Feel free to use our code, just be sure to give us the proper credit!
(And buy us a beer if you meet us)
